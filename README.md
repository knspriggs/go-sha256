## SHA256 in Go

#### Purpose
Learn more about the SHA256 implementation. This is also the topic I picked for my Comp 4109 course project.

#### Speed
On Average this library is 1.5-2 times slower than the standard library's built in SHA256 implementation.

#### Warning
Note, this is not production ready! If you need to use an SHA256 hashing function in production please use the standard library's implementation.
